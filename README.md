# NPS-Feedback-UI

**Link to project:** https://elegant-khapse-ac9f5c.netlify.app/

NPS or net promoter score is used by many companies to make sense of customer reviews and identify key components of their products or services for improvement.

The App is built in JavaScript, using React as a framework.

I built this set of components using create-react-app and as a study to understand the basic react hooks useState and useffect. I also wanted to learn about some of the more complex hooks like useContext and useParams.

# Hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext

# Mobile Responsive View

## Optimizations

I'm a big fan of Test Driven Development TDD, but need to gain more experience in writing tests for react components to really get going with that.
I added JEST to the project with the aim of deepening my knowledge and built snapshot tests for the main components.

## Lessons Learned:

## Examples:

Take a look at these other examples that I have in my own portfolio:

Tenzies: https://github.com/TheWoodenMan/react-tenzies
This simple app was built as a challenge to tie together my knowledge of core react hooks useState and useEffect.

Behavioural Recruitment RESTful API: https://github.com/TheWoodenMan/behavioural-recruitment
This RESTful API was my most detailed exploration of CRUD functions and my first real implementation of mongoose, both of which feature heavily in this app

## Footnote and Credits

Much of the code was put together as part of a code along project by Brad Traversy which can be found here: https://github.com/bradtraversy/feedback-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
